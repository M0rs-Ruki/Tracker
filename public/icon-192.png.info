# This file indicates where app icons should be placed
# You need to add:
# - icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
# - icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)
# 
# You can generate these from your logo/icon using online tools like:
# - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
# - https://favicon.io/
# 
# For now, the app will work without these, but icons are recommended for a better install experience.
